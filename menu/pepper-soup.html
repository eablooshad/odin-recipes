    <h2>Odin Recipes : Pepper Soup</h2>
    <p>Pepper Soup is a popular Nigerian delicacy known for its intense and aromatic flavors. It's a light, spicy soup typically made with fish, goat meat, or chicken. The unique taste of Pepper Soup largely comes from the special blend of spices used in its preparation. Here's how to make it:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g of your choice of protein (fish, goat meat, chicken, or beef)</li>
        <li>4-5 cups of water or broth</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of Pepper Soup spice mix (a blend of spices including ehuru seeds, uziza seeds, and uda seeds)</li>
        <li>1 medium-sized onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ginger, grated</li>
        <li>Salt and seasoning cubes (to taste)</li>
        <li>Optional: lemon grass, scent leaves (nchuanwu), or utazi leaves for added flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Protein:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean and cut your chosen protein into bite-sized pieces. If using fish, it's advisable to use a firm fish to prevent it from falling apart in the soup.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Boil the Meat:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large pot, add the meat (or fish) and enough water or broth to cover it. Add the chopped onions, minced garlic, and grated ginger.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and seasoning cubes. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the meat is tender. For fish, be careful not to overcook.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add the Spices:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the meat is tender, add the Pepper Soup spice mix and Scotch bonnet peppers. If using lemon grass or scent leaves, add them at this stage.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Simmer:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Let the soup simmer on low heat for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. If the soup is too thick, add a bit more water or broth to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Adjust Seasoning:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with additional salt or seasoning cubes if needed.</li>
        </ul><li>Final Touches:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If using, add chopped utazi leaves towards the end of the cooking process for a slightly bitter flavor which balances the spices.</li>
        </ul><li>Serve Hot:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve the Pepper Soup hot as an appetizer or as a main dish. It's particularly comforting during cold weather or as a remedy for colds.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Pepper Soup is incredibly versatile and can be adjusted to suit your palate. The key is in the spice mix, which gives this soup its distinctive flavor. Enjoy your homemade Nigerian Pepper Soup!</p>
