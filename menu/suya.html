    <h2>Odin Recipes: Suya</h2>
    <p>Suya is a popular Nigerian street food, essentially spicy skewered meat grilled to perfection. It's typically made with beef, but you can also use chicken or lamb. The key to Suya is the unique spice blend, known as Suya spice or Yaji, which gives it its distinctive flavor. Here’s how you can make Suya at home:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams of beef (sirloin or flank steak), chicken, or lamb</li>
        <li>Skewers (if wooden, soak in water for at least 20 minutes to prevent burning)</li>
        <p>For the Suya Spice (Yaji):</p>
        <li>1/2 cup of roasted peanuts, ground</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of onion powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <p>Additional:</p>
        <li>1 small onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for brushing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Slice the meat into thin, flat strips, about 1/4 inch thick. This allows the meat to absorb the marinade and cook evenly.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Make the Suya Spice:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the ground peanuts, paprika, ginger, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. Mix well to create the Suya spice blend.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Marinate the Meat:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Generously coat the meat strips with the Suya spice mix. Make sure every piece is well covered.</li>
            <li>Cover and let the meat marinate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator for deeper flavor.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Prepare the Skewers:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Thread the marinated meat onto the skewers. Don’t overcrowd the skewers; leave a little space between each piece to ensure even cooking.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Grill the Suya:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Brush each skewer lightly with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Place the skewers on the grill and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until the meat is cooked to your liking. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the meat and the type of grill used.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve the Suya hot, garnished with slices of onion and tomato. You can also sprinkle some extra Suya spice on top for added flavor.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Enjoy:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Suya is best enjoyed fresh off the grill, accompanied by cold drinks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Suya is not just a dish; it's a cultural experience. The combination of the smoky flavor from grilling and the spicy, nutty taste of the Suya spice is truly unique and delicious. Enjoy your homemade Suya!</p>
