    <h2>Odin Recipes : Jollof Rice</h2>
    <p>A classic West African dish, Jollof rice is a one-pot meal featuring rice cooked in a tomato, onion, and bell pepper base. It's often spiced with thyme, curry powder, and sometimes scotch bonnet peppers for heat.</p>

    <p>Jollof Rice is a beloved West African dish known for its vibrant color and rich flavor. Here's a basic procedure to make Nigerian-style Jollof Rice:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cups of long-grain parboiled rice</li> 
        <li>1/4 cup of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 can of tomato paste (6 oz)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 red bell peppers, blended</li>
        <li>2 ripe tomatoes, blended</li>
        <li>1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers, blended (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ginger, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of curry powder</li>
        <li>4 cups of chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: bay leaves, cooked chicken, shrimp, or vegetables</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the Base:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Blend the red bell peppers, tomatoes, and Scotch bonnet peppers into a smooth mixture. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Rinse the rice in cold water and drain. This helps to remove some of the starch.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cook the Sauce:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic, saut√©ing until they're soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste, ginger, thyme, and curry powder. Cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the blended pepper and tomato mixture to the pot. Cook on medium heat until the mixture thickens and the oil begins to separate from the sauce.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the rinsed rice to the pot. Stir to ensure the rice is well coated with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. The liquid should just cover the rice. Add salt to taste and bay leaves if using.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. Avoid stirring too often to prevent the rice from becoming mushy.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Final Touches:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Check if the rice is cooked through. If it's too firm, you can add a bit more broth or water and continue cooking.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, turn off the heat. Let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fluff the Jollof Rice with a fork and serve. You can garnish it with cooked chicken, shrimp, or vegetables.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your Jollof Rice! This dish is a staple at celebrations and is also enjoyed as an everyday meal. Remember, Jollof Rice is all about personal preference, so feel free to adjust the spices and ingredients to suit your taste.</p>
